# Syntax Conventions

## Symbols:
>A symbol can be any sequence of letters, digits, underscore (_), dot (.), dollar sign ($), and colon (:) that does not begin with a digit.

## Constants:
>May appear only in A-instructions of the form @xxx. The constant xxx is a value in the range 0–32767 and is written in decimal notation.

## White space:
>Leading space characters and empty lines are ignored.

## Case conventions:
>All the assembly mnemonics (like JEQ, and so on) must be written in uppercase. The remaining symbols—labels and variable names—are case-sensitive. The recommended convention is to use uppercase for labels and lowercase for variables.

## Annotation:
>after annotation symbol (//), the line is ignored.
